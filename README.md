## 1. Purpose

ThoughtFull began in August of 2019 as a capstone project for a three-month long Web Developer bootcamp in downtown San Diego. It has since grown from a idea formed during a brainstorm into a complete project, and we look forward to how ThoughtFull will continue to grow in the future.

Today, ThoughtFull has been deployed, and the team is continuing to add features that will improve the channels with which our users interact with one another and with their own stories in meaningful ways.

The purpose of the assignment is to deploy a fully functional, single page application that utilizes authentication and includes CRUD functionality as well as an external API.
